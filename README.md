# Search-Optimisation
an website explaining search optimisation 
changed title from what it was to SOW
added an ID to search optimisation subtitle so that when we click on the title, it goes to the specific content
replaced the first div with main for the header
inside of the main, i have replaced div with nav (for the navigation on the website)
after the header and main, i have replaced the div elements with section, for semantics
Replaced the side pictures represented by div with aside
I have replaced div with footer in the end
I have given an alt attribute to all 6 images
